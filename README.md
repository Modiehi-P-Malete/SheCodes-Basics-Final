# SheCodes-Basics-Final
 This is a project I was tasked with in my SheCodes Final week, wherein I had to apply all the basics of HTML,CSS and JavaScript that I had learned for the past  3+ weeks. It was quite a daunting task, however, I managed to come up with something that made a bit of sense. I do plan on enhancing it some more at some point to give it some more personality, for now though, this is what I have hehe.
